group project idea
data set = olympic data
url: https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games
maps = location of winner, location of olympics, winter (dark), summer (light)

amazon web server:
sql server, code already done in previous group project
flask server code, already done in previous group project

our amazon cloud server will host the following:
our database
our http server
our libraries/dependencies

we will obtain the 2 csv files (dataset) from kaggle
we will then upload the dataset to our amazon web server
we will then do everything in python (queries, joins, exports)
we will use flask (app.py) to show web pages
allow user to manipulate data,
using event listeners, or based on user input

pages: with navbar 
1 index.html = main navigation page (piechart, bar chart, scatter, bubble, actual maps) using D3 and javascript
2 summer.html = summer data (static image)
3 winter.html = winter data (static image)
4 other visuals based on queries (static images)
on homepage, US Based,

queries; 
overall medals per country
gender breakdown 
breakdown of events, sport, and discipline
medal breakdowns

at least one JS library that we did not cover.
-jquery (to change the html page)  https://jquery.com/


// meet 2
layout = general navbar at top, with buttons
main landing page = sample images of other visuals from other pages
page 1 = scatter plot with map: medals won on 1 axis, and gdp on the other axis
pae 2 = 2 diff types of layers on 1 map, dark and light = summer and winter, with tooltip, and filters
for tooltips: medal type and count (gold, silver, bronze), and show GDP in country, and country population.
put a note that GDP is based on 2014 data, not cumulative over all the years of the olympics.
in tooltip also: highest achieving athelete per country.
page 3 = other graphs and visualizations
scatter
pie - think about pie data
